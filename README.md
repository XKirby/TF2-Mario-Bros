# TF2-Mario-Bros
A gamemode for Team Fortress 2 themed upon the Mario franchise.

This gamemode very heavily modifies the gameplay mechanics of Team Fortress 2 to make it more of a crazy party game than a frantic first-person shooter. Instead of using traditional weapons, you must Goomba Stomp your opponents or use Power-Ups that replace ammo boxes on the map to attack the enemy team.

Besides the map's default gamemode, you can also play Arena on any map with no setup, and Coin Rush on any map with some minor tweaking of mariobros_itemspawns.txt to enable new coin spawnpoints.
